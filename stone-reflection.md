##GPS 1.1 Reflections 

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - I wasn't sure about the difference between git pull and git fetch or why one would ever use git fetch, and I didn't understand why it was risky business to work within nested git repos.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - John and David helped to clarify both of the above issues for me during the pairing session
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - Again, I asked questions pertaining to the above issues. I also asked David what he thought about what I was doing when I was the driver and when I was navigator, asked what he was doing if it wasn't clear to me. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - Not a whole lot up to this point. I feel pretty clear on everything.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - It was a lot of fun! David was a great, supportive partner and John was a knowledgeable and helpful guide. It was also great just learning how I worked in that paired environment.
