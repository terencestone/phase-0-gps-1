## David Armbrust's Reflections
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  * Prior to the GPS I was struggling with what were the best practices for commit messages, as far as length and content.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  * There were a couple concepts that I felt were clarified. The best practices on commit messages, but also the proper way to merge and deal with merge conflicts. I had not run in to a conflict yet and it was nice to see how to resolve one.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  * We asked many questions such as why you would use a fetch/merge as opposed to a normal pull request. We also
* What still confuses you about Git?
  * I am still confused on how you can move around in commits effectively to roll back a bug with out losing other work that may have been done since. Commits still feel very linear where I assume you are able to work around in them to roll back specific features, with out effecting the rest of the project.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  * I thought the experience was very informative. I was able to ask and talk through a lot of questions that I have been thinking about during the solo assignments in phase 0.
